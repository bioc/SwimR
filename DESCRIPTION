Description: SwimR is an R-based suite that calculates, analyses, and
        plots the frequency of C. elegans swimming behavior over time.
        It places a particular emphasis on identifying paralysis and
        quantifying the kinetic elements of paralysis during swimming.
        Data is input to SwipR from a custom built program that fits a
        5 point morphometric spine to videos of single worms swimming
        in a buffer called Worm Tracker.
